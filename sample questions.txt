Great! Since you've uploaded tutorial URLs from core areas like Python, Flask, Django, FastAPI, React, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Docker — you can now query a wide range of questions across:

?? General Questions Across All Topics
1. "Summarize the key learning from each tutorial."
2. "What is the best order to learn these technologies for a full-stack ML developer?"
3. "Compare Flask, Django, and FastAPI with pros and cons."
4. "How is TensorFlow different from PyTorch?"
5. "What role does Docker play in deploying applications built with these technologies?"

?? Python Specific
* "What are Python's key data structures?"
* "How does Python manage memory internally?"
* "Explain list comprehensions with examples."

?? Flask, Django, FastAPI
* "How do routing mechanisms differ in Flask, Django, and FastAPI?"
* "Show how to build a REST API in FastAPI."
* "What are Django models and how do they work?"

?? Pandas and NumPy
* "How do Pandas DataFrames differ from NumPy arrays?"
* "Show examples of data cleaning in Pandas."
* "Explain broadcasting in NumPy with code."

?? TensorFlow and PyTorch
* "How do you define and train a model in TensorFlow?"
* "What is autograd in PyTorch?"
* "Compare model serialization in TensorFlow and PyTorch."

?? React
* "What is the virtual DOM in React?"
* "Explain useState and useEffect hooks with examples."
* "How is state management done in React?"

?? Docker
* "How to Dockerize a FastAPI + PyTorch app?"
* "Explain the difference between Dockerfile and docker-compose."
* "What is a Docker volume and when do you use it?"

?? Advanced or Role-Based Prompts
* "As a data scientist, how can I use FastAPI to deploy a model?"
* "How do React and Flask integrate in a full-stack app?"
* "Give me a step-by-step guide to build and deploy a ML model using Pandas, TensorFlow, and Docker."

Would you like me to generate sample queries or automate the chunk + query process inside your RAG system with one of these examples?
